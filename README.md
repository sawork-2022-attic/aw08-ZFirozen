### REPORT 报告

使用`Spring Integration`可以传输更多结构的、更详细的数据，而不必通过一般网络请求传输，一方面便于不同服务程序之间的交互，另一方面还可以由其优秀的数据处理能力提供更多样化的服务接入。



### Original README.md

Run the project with `mvn spring-boot:run` and send request to `http://localhost:8080/check`. You should see an reponses in json format like the following.

```json
{
    "icon_url": "https://assets.chucknorris.host/img/avatar/chuck-norris.png",
    "id": "kswv7NIaTCaIIErlBzODaA",
    "url": "https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/kswv7NIaTCaIIErlBzODaA",
    "value": "Chuck Norris's shadow weighs 250 pounds and can kick your ass ."
}
```

Try to understand the provided code which demonstrates spring integration between a spring boot application with an externel http service (https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random).

Please implement delivery as an standalone service (just like the random joke service). Refer the sample code to integrate your Micropos system with delivery service so that user can check delivery status on Miropos which actually forwards user request to delivery service on demand.

Consider the advantage by doing so and write it down in your readme file.
